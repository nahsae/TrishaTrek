Here’s a ready-to-go brief you can hand off to your coding agent:

---

**Prompt for Coding Agent:**

> **Project:** Trisha’s 25th–Birthday Celebration App
>
> **Objective:** Build a vibrant, mobile-first React application that lets family and friends scroll through an interactive, emoji-rich timeline of Trisha’s life—from her Mumbai school days to her Wall Street career.
>
> **Data Source:** Use the provided JSON array (see below) as the single source of truth for all timeline entries.
>
> **Key Requirements:**
>
> 1. **Timeline Component**
>
>    * Vertical, scrollable “card” layout.
>    * Each card shows:
>
>      * `period` (e.g. “July 2013”)
>      * `title` (e.g. “Freshman at DAIS”)
>      * `description` (emoji-laced text).
>    * Cards should animate into view (e.g. fade/slide on scroll).
> 2. **Styling & Theming**
>
>    * Use Tailwind CSS for styling.
>    * A playful “desi” color palette (warm saffron oranges, deep indigo, festive teal).
>    * Soft rounded corners (2xl), subtle shadows, and generous padding.
> 3. **Interactivity**
>
>    * Hover or tap a card to flip/reveal extra detail (optional Easter egg).
>    * A fixed “🎂 Celebrate Trisha!” button that opens a modal to send birthday wishes or GIFs.
> 4. **Accessibility & Responsiveness**
>
>    * Fully responsive across mobile and desktop.
>    * Keyboard-navigable and screen-reader friendly.
> 5. **Tech Stack**
>
>    * React (TypeScript optional)
>    * Tailwind CSS
>    * Framer Motion for animations
>    * No additional UI libraries required, but you may use lucide-react for icons.
>
> **Deliverables:**
>
> * A single-page app with the interactive timeline.
> * Clean, well-commented code and a README with setup instructions.
>
> **Timeline JSON:**
>
> ```json
> [
>   {
>     "period": "2005–2013",
>     "title": "Early School Days",
>     "description": "Born and raised in Mumbai—chhoti Trisha’s playful childhood filled with home and friend masti! 🏡👧"
>   },
>   {
>     "period": "July 2013",
>     "title": "Freshman at DAIS",
>     "description": "Fresh-faced freshman stepping into Dhirubhai Ambani International School corridors! 🎒"
>   },
>   …
>   {
>     "period": "Future",
>     "title": "25th Birthday Dhamaka",
>     "description": "Planning the biggest birthday bash ever—get ready for full-on dhamal! 🎂🎁🪔"
>   }
> ]
> ```
>
> Feel free to propose any creative flourishes—this should feel like a festive, desi-style celebration in code!
